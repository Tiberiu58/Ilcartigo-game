# ILCARTIGO — Phase 11+ Roadmap (autonomous build)

Goal: make the game **fun, catchy, Krunker-feel**, and **revenue-ready (AdSense)**.
Build steadily, one phase at a time, verifying (typecheck + build, headless tests where
possible) after each. Each phase is independently shippable.

Guiding principles:
- **Readable feedback** — every action has instant, juicy feedback (Krunker's core feel).
- **Visible progression** — players see themselves getting better/richer (levels, streaks, stats).
- **Natural ad breakpoints** — ads between matches / on the death+postmatch screen, never mid-combat.
- **Don't regress** — keep solo + MP + the audit fixes working. Typecheck + build green each phase.
- **No new heavy deps.** Stay within the current stack (Vite/TS/Three/Howler/socket.io).

---

## Phase A — Scoreboard (Tab) + live match HUD polish  ✅ shippable
The single most "Krunker" missing piece: hold **Tab** to see a full scoreboard.
- Tab-held overlay: rank, player name, kills, deaths, K/D, ping (MP). Works solo (you+bots) and MP.
- Sort by kills desc, highlight local player.
- Reuse `Game.matchKills/matchDeaths`; in MP pull from snapshot `kills` so it's authoritative.
- Polish the existing top-center match ticker.
Files: `index.html` (overlay DOM), `main.ts` (Tab key + render), `HUD.ts` (maybe), `site.css`/game css.

## Phase B — Killstreaks + "juice"  ✅ shippable
Krunker-style momentum feedback.
- Track consecutive kills without dying (local player). Announce streaks: Double Kill, Triple,
  Rampage, Unstoppable, Godlike — center-screen banner + escalating sound.
- Multi-kill timing window (kills within ~4s chain into Double/Triple/Multi).
- Hitmarker scale-up + sharper kill confirmation. Headshot = special marker + ding (already partly there).
- Low-HP vignette pulse.
Files: new `client/src/ui/Announcer.ts`, wire into `Game` kill bus, css, sounds catalog (already has hooks).

## Phase C — Footsteps + audio depth  ✅ shippable (finishes audit #footstep)
- Distance-throttled footstep emit in PlayerController (the audit's last unwired sound).
- Per-class footstep volume (Phantom silent, Ghost half) using existing passive fields.
- Remote-player footsteps (spatial) from snapshot movement.
Files: `PlayerController.ts`, `Game.ts`, `MultiplayerSession.ts`, `AudioManager.ts`.

## Phase D — Class selection in MP  ✅ shippable (closes a README limitation)
- Players already pick class in the menu (localStorage `ilc.class`); sync it over the wire.
- `ClientHello` already carries `classId` — make the menu selection actually flow to MP + verify
  abilities/passives work online for all 6 classes (server already validates classId).
- Show other players' class color/identity.
Files: `main.ts` (send hello on class change — already partly wired), verify server `onHello`.

## Phase E — Progression depth + stat tracking  ✅ shippable
Catchy long-term hooks + more reasons to come back.
- Persistent lifetime stats: total kills, deaths, K/D, matches, wins, best streak, headshots, playtime.
- Stats tab in settings (or new "Profile" panel). XP/level already exist — surface lifetime stats too.
- Daily challenge-lite (local): "get 20 kills", "win a match", "5 headshots" → bonus XP. No backend.
Files: `Account.ts` (extend persisted state, migration-safe), new `ProfileUI` / extend CosmeticsUI, css.

## Phase F — AdSense revenue integration  ✅ shippable (the money)
- Interstitial-style ad slot on the **post-match overlay** + **main menu** (natural breakpoints).
- Reserved, responsive ad containers that show a tasteful placeholder until a real `ca-pub` is set.
- Single config point for the publisher id; AdSense script loads only when id is real (not XXXX).
- Respect the existing cookie-consent banner on the website; add a minimal consent gate in-game.
Files: `index.html` (ad containers), new `client/src/ads/Ads.ts`, `main.ts` wiring, css.

## Phase G — UX / first-session catch (retention)  ✅ shippable
- Name entry (persisted) so the scoreboard shows a chosen handle, not a socket id.
- Quick "how to play" first-run card; settings to replay it.
- Crosshair/loadout quick-access; remember last loadout.
Files: `main.ts`, `index.html`, `Account.ts` (name), css.

## Phase H — README + version bump + polish sweep
- Update README with all new phases, bump to the appropriate version.
- Re-run the audit's remaining minor items (respawn-countdown race, iPad gate) if not already done.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase A — Tab scoreboard. DONE + browser-verified (sorted rows, K/D, bot names, "You" highlight, keyup hides). Dev-only `window.game` added for testing (stripped from prod).
- ✅ Phase B — Killstreak/multi-kill announcer. DONE + browser-verified (Double→Mega chain, streak milestones, headline/subline priority, death resets). 11 new sound ids (silent until .wav added). New `ui/Announcer.ts`.
- ✅ Phase C — Footsteps. DONE (typecheck + build clean, wiring verified). Local footsteps (distance-throttled stride, per-class volume via passive, crouch lengthens stride) + remote spatial footsteps in MP (RemotePlayer accumulator, cloak-silent, ignores teleports). Couldn't watch real footfalls in the throttled/lock-gated headless tab — accumulator is deterministic, will fire in a real session.
- ✅ Phase D — MP class selection. DONE + headless-verified. Found the client class flow was ALREADY wired (README's "locked to Vanguard" was stale). Real bugs fixed: two class PASSIVES were silently MP-broken because the server is authoritative but never applied them — Vanguard's +15 HP (server killed them at 100) and Engineer's -15% cooldown. Added CLASS_MAX_HP + CLASS_COOLDOWN_MULT server tables; smoke test confirms Vanguard=115 HP server-side + clean class-switch clamp.
- ✅ Phase E — Lifetime stats + daily challenges. DONE + browser-verified end-to-end. Account extended (migration-safe) with LifetimeStats (kills/deaths/hs/matches/wins/bestStreak/playtime) + daily challenges (seeded-per-day, 3 picked, baseline-captured-at-issue, claim grants bonus XP) + display name. New Profile settings tab (ProfileUI). Wired stat recording into Game kill/death/match-end + playtime tick. Caught+fixed a baseline off-by-one during verification. Claim flow confirmed (+300 XP). New `ui/ProfileUI.ts`.
- ✅ Phase F — AdSense. DONE + browser-verified. New `ads/Ads.ts` — single-config-point publisher id, slots at natural breakpoints (menu top/side + post-match), tasteful in-house placeholders until a real id is set (NO empty real units = policy-safe), no AdSense script loads in placeholder mode (verified), consent-aware npa fallback, refreshSlot on each post-match. Gate logic verified (placeholder→off, real id→on).
- ✅ Phase G — First-session UX. DONE + browser-verified. Name entry shipped in Phase E. Loadout persistence (class/primary/map) already existed. New: first-run "How to Play" card — auto-shows once for new players (gated by ilc.seenHowto), dismiss sets flag, replayable from a new "How to Play" main-menu button. Verified: auto-show, 8 control items, dismiss+flag, menu replay.
- ✅ Phase H — Polish + docs. DONE. Fixed respawn-countdown race (audit #10 — 0.25s grace before auto-clear) + iPad-landscape mobile gate (audit #11 — `(any-pointer: fine)` so touch-only tablets gated even when wide). Bumped client+server to v0.11.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer). README updated with the full Phase 11 section. Hit a UTF-8 BOM gotcha from PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` corrupting package.json → rewrote both via Write (BOM-free); both validate + build clean.

### Phase 11 COMPLETE — all 8 sub-phases (A–H) + audit-fix round shipped, typecheck + build green, app chunk ~59 KB gzip.

## Phase 12 — Combat Feel & Feedback Juice (autonomous build, v0.12.0)

The single biggest gap between ILCARTIGO and Krunker right now is *moment-to-moment
combat feedback* — you can't tell where you're being shot from, low-HP has no
tension, death is abrupt, and there's only one cosmetic axis to chase. Phase 12
closes that, all client-side and low-risk (no protocol changes, solo + MP both
keep working), plus one new cosmetic track to deepen the unlock loop (retention →
ad revenue).

Guiding constraint: **no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green each step.**

- **12A — Directional damage indicators.** Red curved arcs around the crosshair
  pointing at whoever's shooting you (CoD/Krunker staple). Computed from the
  attacker's world position vs camera yaw. Works solo (bots) + MP (remotes).
  New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`, `Game.actorWorldPos()` resolver,
  `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition()`.
- **12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat.** Persistent pulsing red vignette + a
  throttled heartbeat SFX cue when HP drops under a threshold. Pure HUD + CSS.
- **12C — Death recap card.** "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}" on the death
  screen, folded into the respawn countdown. Captured from the lethal kill event.
- **12D — Tracer-colour cosmetics.** A new unlockable cosmetic axis (your bullet
  tracer colour). Extends the registry + Account + Cosmetics settings tab; the
  local player's tracers read the equipped colour. More to chase = more reasons
  to return.
- **12E — Announcer specials.** First Blood (first kill of a match), Revenge
  (kill whoever last killed you), Comeback (kill after a long death drought).
  Pure `Announcer.ts` extension on top of the existing streak/multi-kill system.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 12A — Directional damage indicators. DONE (typecheck + build green). New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`; pooled red arcs rotate about screen centre to the attacker's bearing (camera-yaw projection). Attacker position via new `Game.actorWorldPos` (local/bot/MP-remote) + `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition`. Merges continuous fire, separate arcs for multiple attackers, skips attacker-less hits.
- ✅ Phase 12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat. DONE. Pulsing red `#lowhp-vignette` + throttled `heartbeat` SFX at ≤30% HP (cadence 500–950ms, tighter near death). HUD-driven, edge-toggled.
- ✅ Phase 12C — Death recap card. DONE. "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}(·HS)" inside the respawn countdown; resolves bot labels / short MP ids; hidden for falls.
- ✅ Phase 12D — Bullet-tracer cosmetics. DONE. `TRACERS` registry (6, 0–2000 XP) + `findTracer`/`DEFAULT_TRACER`. Account extended migration-safe (`unlockedTracers`/`equippedTracer`, default kept unlocked on old saves) with unlock/equip + `equippedTracerColor`. Game reads it for local tracers; new Cosmetics grid + tracer swatch CSS.
- ✅ Phase 12E — Announcer specials. DONE. First Blood (match-first kill via a `matchHadKill` flag read-before-set), Revenge (`lastKilledMeBy`), Comeback (`deathsSinceKill >= 3`). Specials headline, multi/streak subline; all reset in `reset()`.
- ✅ Phase 12F — Kill-confirm marker. DONE. Bigger glowing red X on confirmed kill; hit/headshot/kill state classes cleared between flashes.
- ✅ Phase 12 polish — Bumped client+server to v0.12.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer), README Phase 12 section + audio-catalog additions (heartbeat/first_blood/revenge/comeback), deliverables updated. Typecheck (client+server) + client build all green; app chunk ~61 KB gzip.

### Phase 12 COMPLETE — A–F + polish shipped, no protocol change, solo + MP intact.

## Phase 13 — Rank Up & Reward Spectacle (autonomous build, v0.13.0)

The retention pillar. Krunker keeps you coming back by making your *level* visible,
celebrated, and aspirational. ILCARTIGO already tracks XP + a derived level, but it's
buried in a settings tab — there's no rank identity, no level-up moment, no juicy
on-kill reward feedback. Phase 13 surfaces all of it. This is the loop that pairs
directly with AdSense: more return visits + longer sessions = more ad impressions at
the natural breakpoints we already built.

Guiding constraint (same as Phase 12): **no protocol changes, no new deps, client-only,
typecheck + build green each step, solo + MP both keep working.**

- **13A — Rank tiers + level-up celebration.** A named rank ladder derived from level
  (Recruit → … → Mythic), each with an accent colour + glyph. A persistent rank badge
  on the HUD and on the main menu. When XP crosses a level boundary, a full-screen
  "LEVEL UP" banner pops with the new level + rank + a sound sting. New
  `account/Ranks.ts` (pure data/helpers) + `ui/ProgressionFX.ts` (badges, banner,
  popups). New `level_up` sound id.
- **13B — Floating "+XP" reward popups.** Every local kill floats a "+10 XP" chip
  (headshots tagged) near the crosshair that drifts up and fades — the instant,
  dopamine-tight feedback Krunker nails. Driven by `ui/ProgressionFX.ts` off the kill bus.
- **13C — Crosshair preset packs + dynamic-crosshair toggle.** One-click crosshair
  presets (Classic / Dot / Cross / T-style / Precision) plus a "Dynamic crosshair"
  toggle so players who want a static reticle can freeze the firing-spread gap. All on
  the existing CSS-var crosshair pipeline; persisted like the other crosshair settings.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 13A — Rank tiers + level-up celebration. DONE (client tsc + build green; app 62 KB gzip). New `account/Ranks.ts` (8-tier ladder Recruit→Mythic, colour+glyph, `rankForLevel`/`rankProgress`). New `ui/ProgressionFX.ts` drives a shared rank badge on the HUD (bottom-left) + main menu (under subtitle) and a full-screen "LEVEL UP · Lv N · RANK" banner that pops on a net level increase (XP spends that lower the level re-sync the badge silently, no false celebration). New `level_up` sound id (silent until .wav added). Badges re-sync on every account mutation.
- ✅ Phase 13B — Floating "+XP" reward popups. DONE. ProgressionFX listens to the kill bus; every local kill floats a "+10 XP" (headshots tagged "· HS", pink) chip near the crosshair that rises + fades (1.1s, horizontal jitter so stacked kills don't overlap). Skips suicides/falls. `rewardPopup()` is public for future post-match/challenge reuse.
- ✅ Phase 13D — Per-weapon server damage (MP combat-feel fix). DONE (server tsc green; boots clean at 32Hz, HTTP 200, protocol v2 unchanged). The server previously applied hardcoded AR damage (24 / 1.8×) to EVERY weapon, so weapon choice was cosmetic online — snipers didn't one-shot, SMGs didn't chip. Added `SERVER_WEAPONS` table + `weaponDamage(weaponId, distance, isHeadshot)` mirroring the client's `WeaponConfig` base damage, headshot multiplier, and linear falloff ramp exactly (distance = the hitscan ray's `bestT`). Sniper now one-shots heads (111 > 100, but < Vanguard's 115 — passive still matters), SMG chips, pistol is a real sidearm. SHOTGUN is the one intentional divergence (single aim ray can't replicate 9-pellet spread → tuned 52-dmg center blast w/ hard falloff; documented inline). No protocol change; client doesn't predict its own damage so there's no desync — MP damage numbers are now per-weapon-accurate.
- ✅ Phase 13C — Crosshair presets + dynamic toggle. DONE. 5 one-click shape presets write through to the existing crosshair inputs + CSS vars + localStorage (colour left untouched — it's personal). New `--ch-top` var lets the T-Style preset hide the top pip; new `--ch-dynamic` var + "Dynamic crosshair" checkbox lets HUD.tickCrosshairSpread freeze the firing-spread gap for a fixed reticle. Both persisted (`ilc.ch.top` / `ilc.ch.dynamic`). Preview crosshair honours both new vars too.
