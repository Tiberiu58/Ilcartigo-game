# ILCARTIGO — Phase 11+ Roadmap (autonomous build)

Goal: make the game **fun, catchy, Krunker-feel**, and **revenue-ready (AdSense)**.
Build steadily, one phase at a time, verifying (typecheck + build, headless tests where
possible) after each. Each phase is independently shippable.

Guiding principles:
- **Readable feedback** — every action has instant, juicy feedback (Krunker's core feel).
- **Visible progression** — players see themselves getting better/richer (levels, streaks, stats).
- **Natural ad breakpoints** — ads between matches / on the death+postmatch screen, never mid-combat.
- **Don't regress** — keep solo + MP + the audit fixes working. Typecheck + build green each phase.
- **No new heavy deps.** Stay within the current stack (Vite/TS/Three/Howler/socket.io).

---

## Phase A — Scoreboard (Tab) + live match HUD polish  ✅ shippable
The single most "Krunker" missing piece: hold **Tab** to see a full scoreboard.
- Tab-held overlay: rank, player name, kills, deaths, K/D, ping (MP). Works solo (you+bots) and MP.
- Sort by kills desc, highlight local player.
- Reuse `Game.matchKills/matchDeaths`; in MP pull from snapshot `kills` so it's authoritative.
- Polish the existing top-center match ticker.
Files: `index.html` (overlay DOM), `main.ts` (Tab key + render), `HUD.ts` (maybe), `site.css`/game css.

## Phase B — Killstreaks + "juice"  ✅ shippable
Krunker-style momentum feedback.
- Track consecutive kills without dying (local player). Announce streaks: Double Kill, Triple,
  Rampage, Unstoppable, Godlike — center-screen banner + escalating sound.
- Multi-kill timing window (kills within ~4s chain into Double/Triple/Multi).
- Hitmarker scale-up + sharper kill confirmation. Headshot = special marker + ding (already partly there).
- Low-HP vignette pulse.
Files: new `client/src/ui/Announcer.ts`, wire into `Game` kill bus, css, sounds catalog (already has hooks).

## Phase C — Footsteps + audio depth  ✅ shippable (finishes audit #footstep)
- Distance-throttled footstep emit in PlayerController (the audit's last unwired sound).
- Per-class footstep volume (Phantom silent, Ghost half) using existing passive fields.
- Remote-player footsteps (spatial) from snapshot movement.
Files: `PlayerController.ts`, `Game.ts`, `MultiplayerSession.ts`, `AudioManager.ts`.

## Phase D — Class selection in MP  ✅ shippable (closes a README limitation)
- Players already pick class in the menu (localStorage `ilc.class`); sync it over the wire.
- `ClientHello` already carries `classId` — make the menu selection actually flow to MP + verify
  abilities/passives work online for all 6 classes (server already validates classId).
- Show other players' class color/identity.
Files: `main.ts` (send hello on class change — already partly wired), verify server `onHello`.

## Phase E — Progression depth + stat tracking  ✅ shippable
Catchy long-term hooks + more reasons to come back.
- Persistent lifetime stats: total kills, deaths, K/D, matches, wins, best streak, headshots, playtime.
- Stats tab in settings (or new "Profile" panel). XP/level already exist — surface lifetime stats too.
- Daily challenge-lite (local): "get 20 kills", "win a match", "5 headshots" → bonus XP. No backend.
Files: `Account.ts` (extend persisted state, migration-safe), new `ProfileUI` / extend CosmeticsUI, css.

## Phase F — AdSense revenue integration  ✅ shippable (the money)
- Interstitial-style ad slot on the **post-match overlay** + **main menu** (natural breakpoints).
- Reserved, responsive ad containers that show a tasteful placeholder until a real `ca-pub` is set.
- Single config point for the publisher id; AdSense script loads only when id is real (not XXXX).
- Respect the existing cookie-consent banner on the website; add a minimal consent gate in-game.
Files: `index.html` (ad containers), new `client/src/ads/Ads.ts`, `main.ts` wiring, css.

## Phase G — UX / first-session catch (retention)  ✅ shippable
- Name entry (persisted) so the scoreboard shows a chosen handle, not a socket id.
- Quick "how to play" first-run card; settings to replay it.
- Crosshair/loadout quick-access; remember last loadout.
Files: `main.ts`, `index.html`, `Account.ts` (name), css.

## Phase H — README + version bump + polish sweep
- Update README with all new phases, bump to the appropriate version.
- Re-run the audit's remaining minor items (respawn-countdown race, iPad gate) if not already done.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase A — Tab scoreboard. DONE + browser-verified (sorted rows, K/D, bot names, "You" highlight, keyup hides). Dev-only `window.game` added for testing (stripped from prod).
- ✅ Phase B — Killstreak/multi-kill announcer. DONE + browser-verified (Double→Mega chain, streak milestones, headline/subline priority, death resets). 11 new sound ids (silent until .wav added). New `ui/Announcer.ts`.
- ✅ Phase C — Footsteps. DONE (typecheck + build clean, wiring verified). Local footsteps (distance-throttled stride, per-class volume via passive, crouch lengthens stride) + remote spatial footsteps in MP (RemotePlayer accumulator, cloak-silent, ignores teleports). Couldn't watch real footfalls in the throttled/lock-gated headless tab — accumulator is deterministic, will fire in a real session.
- ✅ Phase D — MP class selection. DONE + headless-verified. Found the client class flow was ALREADY wired (README's "locked to Vanguard" was stale). Real bugs fixed: two class PASSIVES were silently MP-broken because the server is authoritative but never applied them — Vanguard's +15 HP (server killed them at 100) and Engineer's -15% cooldown. Added CLASS_MAX_HP + CLASS_COOLDOWN_MULT server tables; smoke test confirms Vanguard=115 HP server-side + clean class-switch clamp.
- ✅ Phase E — Lifetime stats + daily challenges. DONE + browser-verified end-to-end. Account extended (migration-safe) with LifetimeStats (kills/deaths/hs/matches/wins/bestStreak/playtime) + daily challenges (seeded-per-day, 3 picked, baseline-captured-at-issue, claim grants bonus XP) + display name. New Profile settings tab (ProfileUI). Wired stat recording into Game kill/death/match-end + playtime tick. Caught+fixed a baseline off-by-one during verification. Claim flow confirmed (+300 XP). New `ui/ProfileUI.ts`.
- ✅ Phase F — AdSense. DONE + browser-verified. New `ads/Ads.ts` — single-config-point publisher id, slots at natural breakpoints (menu top/side + post-match), tasteful in-house placeholders until a real id is set (NO empty real units = policy-safe), no AdSense script loads in placeholder mode (verified), consent-aware npa fallback, refreshSlot on each post-match. Gate logic verified (placeholder→off, real id→on).
- ✅ Phase G — First-session UX. DONE + browser-verified. Name entry shipped in Phase E. Loadout persistence (class/primary/map) already existed. New: first-run "How to Play" card — auto-shows once for new players (gated by ilc.seenHowto), dismiss sets flag, replayable from a new "How to Play" main-menu button. Verified: auto-show, 8 control items, dismiss+flag, menu replay.
- ✅ Phase H — Polish + docs. DONE. Fixed respawn-countdown race (audit #10 — 0.25s grace before auto-clear) + iPad-landscape mobile gate (audit #11 — `(any-pointer: fine)` so touch-only tablets gated even when wide). Bumped client+server to v0.11.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer). README updated with the full Phase 11 section. Hit a UTF-8 BOM gotcha from PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` corrupting package.json → rewrote both via Write (BOM-free); both validate + build clean.

### Phase 11 COMPLETE — all 8 sub-phases (A–H) + audit-fix round shipped, typecheck + build green, app chunk ~59 KB gzip.

## Phase 12 — Combat Feel & Feedback Juice (autonomous build, v0.12.0)

The single biggest gap between ILCARTIGO and Krunker right now is *moment-to-moment
combat feedback* — you can't tell where you're being shot from, low-HP has no
tension, death is abrupt, and there's only one cosmetic axis to chase. Phase 12
closes that, all client-side and low-risk (no protocol changes, solo + MP both
keep working), plus one new cosmetic track to deepen the unlock loop (retention →
ad revenue).

Guiding constraint: **no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green each step.**

- **12A — Directional damage indicators.** Red curved arcs around the crosshair
  pointing at whoever's shooting you (CoD/Krunker staple). Computed from the
  attacker's world position vs camera yaw. Works solo (bots) + MP (remotes).
  New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`, `Game.actorWorldPos()` resolver,
  `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition()`.
- **12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat.** Persistent pulsing red vignette + a
  throttled heartbeat SFX cue when HP drops under a threshold. Pure HUD + CSS.
- **12C — Death recap card.** "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}" on the death
  screen, folded into the respawn countdown. Captured from the lethal kill event.
- **12D — Tracer-colour cosmetics.** A new unlockable cosmetic axis (your bullet
  tracer colour). Extends the registry + Account + Cosmetics settings tab; the
  local player's tracers read the equipped colour. More to chase = more reasons
  to return.
- **12E — Announcer specials.** First Blood (first kill of a match), Revenge
  (kill whoever last killed you), Comeback (kill after a long death drought).
  Pure `Announcer.ts` extension on top of the existing streak/multi-kill system.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 12A — Directional damage indicators. DONE (typecheck + build green). New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`; pooled red arcs rotate about screen centre to the attacker's bearing (camera-yaw projection). Attacker position via new `Game.actorWorldPos` (local/bot/MP-remote) + `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition`. Merges continuous fire, separate arcs for multiple attackers, skips attacker-less hits.
- ✅ Phase 12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat. DONE. Pulsing red `#lowhp-vignette` + throttled `heartbeat` SFX at ≤30% HP (cadence 500–950ms, tighter near death). HUD-driven, edge-toggled.
- ✅ Phase 12C — Death recap card. DONE. "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}(·HS)" inside the respawn countdown; resolves bot labels / short MP ids; hidden for falls.
- ✅ Phase 12D — Bullet-tracer cosmetics. DONE. `TRACERS` registry (6, 0–2000 XP) + `findTracer`/`DEFAULT_TRACER`. Account extended migration-safe (`unlockedTracers`/`equippedTracer`, default kept unlocked on old saves) with unlock/equip + `equippedTracerColor`. Game reads it for local tracers; new Cosmetics grid + tracer swatch CSS.
- ✅ Phase 12E — Announcer specials. DONE. First Blood (match-first kill via a `matchHadKill` flag read-before-set), Revenge (`lastKilledMeBy`), Comeback (`deathsSinceKill >= 3`). Specials headline, multi/streak subline; all reset in `reset()`.
- ✅ Phase 12F — Kill-confirm marker. DONE. Bigger glowing red X on confirmed kill; hit/headshot/kill state classes cleared between flashes.
- ✅ Phase 12 polish — Bumped client+server to v0.12.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer), README Phase 12 section + audio-catalog additions (heartbeat/first_blood/revenge/comeback), deliverables updated. Typecheck (client+server) + client build all green; app chunk ~61 KB gzip.

### Phase 12 COMPLETE — A–F + polish shipped, no protocol change, solo + MP intact.

---

## Phase 13 — Gun Game mode (v0.13.0)

The first NEW GAME MODE — mode variety is the #1 driver of replay value in arena
shooters (Krunker has a dozen). Self-contained, solo-vs-bots for v1, no protocol
or MP changes, fully browser-verified.

- **Weapon ladder** `smg → ar → shotgun → sniper → pistol` (`GUNGAME_LADDER`).
  Each kill advances the killer one rung; the player's gun visibly swaps in hand.
  First to land a kill on the FINAL rung (pistol) wins → post-match overlay.
- **New `modes/GunGame.ts`** — bus-driven, decoupled via a small `GunGameHost`
  interface (isLocalPlayer / setPlayerPrimaryWeapon / playSound). Tracks per-
  participant tiers; bots race too (their tier advances, weapon stays fixed for v1).
- **`GameMode` extended** to `'combat' | 'practice' | 'gungame'` + an `isCombatMode()`
  helper so bots/spawn-protection/map logic treat Gun Game like Combat.
- **New `Game.setPlayerPrimaryWeapon(id)`** — swaps primary + viewmodel. Pistol is
  special-cased (it's the secondary slot; `setPrimary` rejects it) → selects slot 1.
  **Caught + fixed during verification**: without this the final rung silently
  stayed on sniper.
- **HUD**: new top-center Gun Game ticker — "LVL n/5 · WEAPON" + filled pips.
  Shown only in gungame mode; hidden on quit/other modes.
- **Menu**: new "🔫 Gun Game (vs Bots)" button. Play Again restarts the ladder;
  Quit restores the player's chosen loadout weapon.
- Verified in-browser end-to-end: starts on SMG, climbs AR→SHOTGUN→SNIPER→PISTOL
  over 4 kills, 5th kill (on pistol) fires the win + post-match. Typecheck (client)
  + build green; app chunk ~61.6 KB gzip.

### Phase 13 COMPLETE — Gun Game shipped, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 14 — "Last Stand" Survival mode (v0.14.0)

The second NEW GAME MODE — a wave-based horde survival run (solo vs bots). Mode
variety is the #1 driver of replay value, and Survival adds a *high-score chase*
retention loop (deeper run = bigger flex) that brings players back — and "back"
is exactly what AdSense revenue needs. Self-contained like Gun Game, no protocol
or MP changes, fully solo.

The loop: clear a wave of bots → short intermission → a bigger, harder wave.
There is **no respawn** — one death ends the run. You chase a personal best
(highest wave + score), persisted locally.

- **Weapon-free escalation.** Each wave spawns more enemies (3 → +1/wave, capped
  at 10) and shifts the difficulty mix from harmless Wanderers toward lethal
  Predictors (`Survival.waveComposition`). Clearing a wave grants a score bonus
  (`wave × 250`) + a half-heal of breathing room.
- **Scoring** — per-kill by difficulty (Wanderer 100 / Engager 150 / Predictor
  250) + headshot bonus (75) + the wave-clear bonus. End-of-run XP =
  `floor(score/100)×5 + wave×20`.
- **New `modes/Survival.ts`** — bus-driven, decoupled via a small `SurvivalHost`
  interface (isLocalPlayer / spawnBot / clearWaveBots / healPlayer / playerAlive
  / playSound), mirroring GunGame. Pure logic → headless-smoke-tested (wave 1 = 3
  bots, scoring incl. headshot, wave-clear fires once + waits for the UI to
  advance, player-death → game over, post-death kills ignored, count caps at 10).
- **Managed wave-bot pool in Game.** New `spawnSurvivalBot(difficulty)` /
  `clearSurvivalBots()` + a `survivalBots` list. Survival bots are real `Bot`s
  (tick / render / hittable / count on the scoreboard) but flagged
  `autoRespawn = false` so a kill is permanent — the wave clears when they're all
  down. `Bot.dispose()` added to free them between waves. `syncBotState` parks
  the fixed combat trio during Survival; `setMode` clears wave bots on exit; the
  kill handler's solo auto-respawn is gated off for Survival (death = game over).
- **GameMode extended** to include `'survival'`; `isCombatMode()` covers it (so
  spawn protection / map logic / bot ticking treat it like Combat).
- **HUD**: new top-center Survival ticker — "WAVE n · n left · n pts".
- **Intermission**: a **non-blocking** centered banner with a live countdown —
  the player stays pointer-locked so the horde loop snaps into the next wave
  (re-locking from a timer would need a user gesture and fail). Snappy
  Krunker-feel over a forced pause.
- **Game-over card** (`#survival-over`): run summary (wave/score) + personal best
  + "★ NEW PERSONAL BEST ★" + XP earned, with the mode's **ad breakpoint** (a
  reliable non-combat pause exactly like post-match). Play Again / Quit.
- **Account**: migration-safe `survivalBest {wave, score}` + `recordSurvivalRun`
  (best keyed on wave then score). Surfaced as two cells in the Profile tab.
- **Menu**: new "🩸 Last Stand (Survival)" button. Ads: new `survival-over` slot.
- New sound ids reserved (silent until `.wav`s land): `wave_start`,
  `wave_clear`, `game_over`.
- Verified: client tsc + build green (app chunk ~63.3 KB gzip), server tsc green,
  Survival logic smoke test passed, all DOM ids cross-checked. Bumped client +
  server to v0.14.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer).

### Phase 14 COMPLETE — Last Stand survival shipped, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 15 — Progression feedback (v0.15.0)

Progression already existed (XP, levels, cosmetics, lifetime stats) but was
nearly *invisible* in play — you only saw it by opening Settings. Phase 15
surfaces it moment-to-moment. Visible progression is the core retention loop,
and return visits are exactly what AdSense revenue runs on. Pure client, no
protocol changes, all modes.

- **Floating "+N XP" popups.** Every XP gain (kill, match/run bonus, daily-claim)
  floats a chip up near the killfeed. Instant feedback tying each action back to
  the loop. Capped at 5 concurrent so a big claim can't flood.
- **LEVEL UP banner.** Crossing a level (1000 XP each) flashes a celebratory
  center-top banner + sting (`level_up`), drawn above every overlay (end-of-match
  bonuses are a common level-up moment).
- **Unlock nudges.** The post-match overlay (was an empty placeholder) and the
  Survival game-over card now show "★ N cosmetics ready to unlock" when XP has
  reached cosmetics the player hasn't bought — a gentle pull back into Settings ›
  Cosmetics. New `Account.affordableLockedCount()` spans skins + kill-effects +
  tracers.
- **New `ui/Rewards.ts`** — account-driven (subscribes to `Account.onChange`,
  diffs XP + level), zero runtime cost, decoupled. Captures the baseline at
  construction so existing XP never triggers a spurious popup; XP *decreases*
  (unlocks) never pop.
- New sound id reserved (silent until `.wav`): `level_up`.
- Verified: client tsc + build green (app chunk ~63.8 KB gzip), server tsc green,
  all DOM ids cross-checked. Bumped client + server to v0.15.0.

### Phase 15 COMPLETE — progression feedback shipped, all modes intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 16 — Survival health pickups (v0.16.0)

A no-respawn horde mode lives or dies on healing — Survival only gave a 50% heal
between waves, so a single bad wave snowballed into death with no counterplay.
Phase 16 adds **health-orb drops**: killed wave bots have a chance to drop a
glowing green orb that heals on pickup. This adds the classic risk/reward chase
(push for the drop vs. play safe) that makes horde modes fun + tense. Contained,
gated to Survival + solo, no protocol changes.

- **New `entities/Pickup.ts`** — a dumb collectible orb (spinning/bobbing
  octahedron + ground-glow ring). No collision registration (you walk through
  it). `update` (spin/bob) + `dispose` (frees GPU resources). Generic on `kind`
  (just `'health'` for v1).
- **Game wiring (additive, gated).** `pickups` list + `spawnPickup` /
  `clearPickups` / `updatePickups`. On a Survival bot kill (solo only), a 33%
  roll drops a 35-HP orb at the corpse. `updatePickups` (tick step 3a, solo
  only) spins orbs + collects on player overlap (radius 1.3 m) → heal + chime +
  dispose. Pickups never carry across a mode switch / run start / quit.
- **Audio**: new `pickup_health` sound id (silent until `.wav`).
- Verified: client tsc + build green (app chunk ~64.3 KB gzip), server tsc green.
  Drop is `!mp && mode==='survival' && !youDied` gated; collection is `!mp`
  gated — combat / MP / practice are untouched. Bumped client + server to
  v0.16.0.

### Phase 16 COMPLETE — Survival health pickups shipped, other modes intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 17 — Crosshair preset packs (v0.17.0)

A new **cosmetic unlock axis** — crosshair presets. Everyone fiddles with their
crosshair, so it's a high-pull, cheap-to-author unlock track that pairs directly
with the Phase 15 unlock-nudge loop (more affordable cosmetics → more "ready to
unlock" pulls → more return sessions → more ad impressions). Pure client, no
protocol changes.

- **6 presets** (`CROSSHAIRS`): Classic (free), Micro Dot, T-Cross, Wide Pro,
  Precision, Crimson Tac — 0–1500 XP. Each is a named bundle of the existing
  per-control settings (colour / size / thickness / gap / outline / dot).
- **Account** extended migration-safe: `unlockedCrosshairs` + `equippedCrosshair`
  (default kept unlocked on old saves) with `isCrosshairUnlocked` /
  `tryUnlockCrosshair` / `equipCrosshair`. Folded into `affordableLockedCount`
  so crosshairs feed the unlock nudges too.
- **Cosmetics tab** gains a Crosshair Preset grid with a mini live preview swatch
  (plus + optional dot, coloured by the preset). Equipping applies the preset to
  the live HUD **and** syncs the Crosshair-tab controls + localStorage via a new
  `applyCrosshairPreset` callback wired from main.ts — the two stay consistent,
  and the player can still fine-tune afterward.
- Verified: client tsc + build green (app chunk ~65 KB gzip), server tsc green,
  new DOM id cross-checked. Bumped client + server to v0.17.0.

### Phase 17 COMPLETE — crosshair preset packs shipped, no protocol change, all modes intact.

---

## Phase 18 — Survival combo multiplier (v0.18.0)

Deepens the Survival score chase (the retention hook) with a **combo multiplier**
— rapid consecutive kills build an escalating score multiplier, the satisfying
"big numbers" loop that makes horde modes addictive. Contained to `Survival.ts`
+ HUD, no protocol changes.

- **Combo logic** (`Survival.ts`). Consecutive kills within a 3 s window build a
  combo; the multiplier tiers ×1 → ×1.5 (3) → ×2 (5) → ×3 (8) → ×4 (12+) via
  `comboMultiplier()`. Each kill's score is `round(base × mult)`. The combo
  resets on a slow kill (window lapse) and on wave clear (the 6 s intermission
  outlasts the window). `SurvivalHud` now carries `combo` + `multiplier`; a new
  `onCombo` callback drives the flash.
- **HUD**. A multiplier chip (`×N`) in the Survival ticker (shown only while a
  combo is live) + a center "×N COMBO" pop on each multiplier kill. Both hidden
  on game-over / quit / mode switch.
- Verified: client tsc + build green (app chunk ~65.3 KB gzip), server tsc green,
  combo logic smoke-tested (tiers correct, scoring `100+100+150+250 bonus = 600`,
  combo flash at 3, reset on wave clear). Bumped client + server to v0.18.0.

### Phase 18 COMPLETE — Survival combo multiplier shipped, other modes intact, no protocol change.
