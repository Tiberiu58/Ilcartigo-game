# ILCARTIGO — Phase 11+ Roadmap (autonomous build)

Goal: make the game **fun, catchy, Krunker-feel**, and **revenue-ready (AdSense)**.
Build steadily, one phase at a time, verifying (typecheck + build, headless tests where
possible) after each. Each phase is independently shippable.

Guiding principles:
- **Readable feedback** — every action has instant, juicy feedback (Krunker's core feel).
- **Visible progression** — players see themselves getting better/richer (levels, streaks, stats).
- **Natural ad breakpoints** — ads between matches / on the death+postmatch screen, never mid-combat.
- **Don't regress** — keep solo + MP + the audit fixes working. Typecheck + build green each phase.
- **No new heavy deps.** Stay within the current stack (Vite/TS/Three/Howler/socket.io).

---

## Phase A — Scoreboard (Tab) + live match HUD polish  ✅ shippable
The single most "Krunker" missing piece: hold **Tab** to see a full scoreboard.
- Tab-held overlay: rank, player name, kills, deaths, K/D, ping (MP). Works solo (you+bots) and MP.
- Sort by kills desc, highlight local player.
- Reuse `Game.matchKills/matchDeaths`; in MP pull from snapshot `kills` so it's authoritative.
- Polish the existing top-center match ticker.
Files: `index.html` (overlay DOM), `main.ts` (Tab key + render), `HUD.ts` (maybe), `site.css`/game css.

## Phase B — Killstreaks + "juice"  ✅ shippable
Krunker-style momentum feedback.
- Track consecutive kills without dying (local player). Announce streaks: Double Kill, Triple,
  Rampage, Unstoppable, Godlike — center-screen banner + escalating sound.
- Multi-kill timing window (kills within ~4s chain into Double/Triple/Multi).
- Hitmarker scale-up + sharper kill confirmation. Headshot = special marker + ding (already partly there).
- Low-HP vignette pulse.
Files: new `client/src/ui/Announcer.ts`, wire into `Game` kill bus, css, sounds catalog (already has hooks).

## Phase C — Footsteps + audio depth  ✅ shippable (finishes audit #footstep)
- Distance-throttled footstep emit in PlayerController (the audit's last unwired sound).
- Per-class footstep volume (Phantom silent, Ghost half) using existing passive fields.
- Remote-player footsteps (spatial) from snapshot movement.
Files: `PlayerController.ts`, `Game.ts`, `MultiplayerSession.ts`, `AudioManager.ts`.

## Phase D — Class selection in MP  ✅ shippable (closes a README limitation)
- Players already pick class in the menu (localStorage `ilc.class`); sync it over the wire.
- `ClientHello` already carries `classId` — make the menu selection actually flow to MP + verify
  abilities/passives work online for all 6 classes (server already validates classId).
- Show other players' class color/identity.
Files: `main.ts` (send hello on class change — already partly wired), verify server `onHello`.

## Phase E — Progression depth + stat tracking  ✅ shippable
Catchy long-term hooks + more reasons to come back.
- Persistent lifetime stats: total kills, deaths, K/D, matches, wins, best streak, headshots, playtime.
- Stats tab in settings (or new "Profile" panel). XP/level already exist — surface lifetime stats too.
- Daily challenge-lite (local): "get 20 kills", "win a match", "5 headshots" → bonus XP. No backend.
Files: `Account.ts` (extend persisted state, migration-safe), new `ProfileUI` / extend CosmeticsUI, css.

## Phase F — AdSense revenue integration  ✅ shippable (the money)
- Interstitial-style ad slot on the **post-match overlay** + **main menu** (natural breakpoints).
- Reserved, responsive ad containers that show a tasteful placeholder until a real `ca-pub` is set.
- Single config point for the publisher id; AdSense script loads only when id is real (not XXXX).
- Respect the existing cookie-consent banner on the website; add a minimal consent gate in-game.
Files: `index.html` (ad containers), new `client/src/ads/Ads.ts`, `main.ts` wiring, css.

## Phase G — UX / first-session catch (retention)  ✅ shippable
- Name entry (persisted) so the scoreboard shows a chosen handle, not a socket id.
- Quick "how to play" first-run card; settings to replay it.
- Crosshair/loadout quick-access; remember last loadout.
Files: `main.ts`, `index.html`, `Account.ts` (name), css.

## Phase H — README + version bump + polish sweep
- Update README with all new phases, bump to the appropriate version.
- Re-run the audit's remaining minor items (respawn-countdown race, iPad gate) if not already done.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase A — Tab scoreboard. DONE + browser-verified (sorted rows, K/D, bot names, "You" highlight, keyup hides). Dev-only `window.game` added for testing (stripped from prod).
- ✅ Phase B — Killstreak/multi-kill announcer. DONE + browser-verified (Double→Mega chain, streak milestones, headline/subline priority, death resets). 11 new sound ids (silent until .wav added). New `ui/Announcer.ts`.
- ✅ Phase C — Footsteps. DONE (typecheck + build clean, wiring verified). Local footsteps (distance-throttled stride, per-class volume via passive, crouch lengthens stride) + remote spatial footsteps in MP (RemotePlayer accumulator, cloak-silent, ignores teleports). Couldn't watch real footfalls in the throttled/lock-gated headless tab — accumulator is deterministic, will fire in a real session.
- ✅ Phase D — MP class selection. DONE + headless-verified. Found the client class flow was ALREADY wired (README's "locked to Vanguard" was stale). Real bugs fixed: two class PASSIVES were silently MP-broken because the server is authoritative but never applied them — Vanguard's +15 HP (server killed them at 100) and Engineer's -15% cooldown. Added CLASS_MAX_HP + CLASS_COOLDOWN_MULT server tables; smoke test confirms Vanguard=115 HP server-side + clean class-switch clamp.
- ✅ Phase E — Lifetime stats + daily challenges. DONE + browser-verified end-to-end. Account extended (migration-safe) with LifetimeStats (kills/deaths/hs/matches/wins/bestStreak/playtime) + daily challenges (seeded-per-day, 3 picked, baseline-captured-at-issue, claim grants bonus XP) + display name. New Profile settings tab (ProfileUI). Wired stat recording into Game kill/death/match-end + playtime tick. Caught+fixed a baseline off-by-one during verification. Claim flow confirmed (+300 XP). New `ui/ProfileUI.ts`.
- ✅ Phase F — AdSense. DONE + browser-verified. New `ads/Ads.ts` — single-config-point publisher id, slots at natural breakpoints (menu top/side + post-match), tasteful in-house placeholders until a real id is set (NO empty real units = policy-safe), no AdSense script loads in placeholder mode (verified), consent-aware npa fallback, refreshSlot on each post-match. Gate logic verified (placeholder→off, real id→on).
- ✅ Phase G — First-session UX. DONE + browser-verified. Name entry shipped in Phase E. Loadout persistence (class/primary/map) already existed. New: first-run "How to Play" card — auto-shows once for new players (gated by ilc.seenHowto), dismiss sets flag, replayable from a new "How to Play" main-menu button. Verified: auto-show, 8 control items, dismiss+flag, menu replay.
- ✅ Phase H — Polish + docs. DONE. Fixed respawn-countdown race (audit #10 — 0.25s grace before auto-clear) + iPad-landscape mobile gate (audit #11 — `(any-pointer: fine)` so touch-only tablets gated even when wide). Bumped client+server to v0.11.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer). README updated with the full Phase 11 section. Hit a UTF-8 BOM gotcha from PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` corrupting package.json → rewrote both via Write (BOM-free); both validate + build clean.

### Phase 11 COMPLETE — all 8 sub-phases (A–H) + audit-fix round shipped, typecheck + build green, app chunk ~59 KB gzip.

## Phase 12 — Combat Feel & Feedback Juice (autonomous build, v0.12.0)

The single biggest gap between ILCARTIGO and Krunker right now is *moment-to-moment
combat feedback* — you can't tell where you're being shot from, low-HP has no
tension, death is abrupt, and there's only one cosmetic axis to chase. Phase 12
closes that, all client-side and low-risk (no protocol changes, solo + MP both
keep working), plus one new cosmetic track to deepen the unlock loop (retention →
ad revenue).

Guiding constraint: **no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green each step.**

- **12A — Directional damage indicators.** Red curved arcs around the crosshair
  pointing at whoever's shooting you (CoD/Krunker staple). Computed from the
  attacker's world position vs camera yaw. Works solo (bots) + MP (remotes).
  New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`, `Game.actorWorldPos()` resolver,
  `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition()`.
- **12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat.** Persistent pulsing red vignette + a
  throttled heartbeat SFX cue when HP drops under a threshold. Pure HUD + CSS.
- **12C — Death recap card.** "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}" on the death
  screen, folded into the respawn countdown. Captured from the lethal kill event.
- **12D — Tracer-colour cosmetics.** A new unlockable cosmetic axis (your bullet
  tracer colour). Extends the registry + Account + Cosmetics settings tab; the
  local player's tracers read the equipped colour. More to chase = more reasons
  to return.
- **12E — Announcer specials.** First Blood (first kill of a match), Revenge
  (kill whoever last killed you), Comeback (kill after a long death drought).
  Pure `Announcer.ts` extension on top of the existing streak/multi-kill system.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 12A — Directional damage indicators. DONE (typecheck + build green). New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`; pooled red arcs rotate about screen centre to the attacker's bearing (camera-yaw projection). Attacker position via new `Game.actorWorldPos` (local/bot/MP-remote) + `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition`. Merges continuous fire, separate arcs for multiple attackers, skips attacker-less hits.
- ✅ Phase 12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat. DONE. Pulsing red `#lowhp-vignette` + throttled `heartbeat` SFX at ≤30% HP (cadence 500–950ms, tighter near death). HUD-driven, edge-toggled.
- ✅ Phase 12C — Death recap card. DONE. "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}(·HS)" inside the respawn countdown; resolves bot labels / short MP ids; hidden for falls.
- ✅ Phase 12D — Bullet-tracer cosmetics. DONE. `TRACERS` registry (6, 0–2000 XP) + `findTracer`/`DEFAULT_TRACER`. Account extended migration-safe (`unlockedTracers`/`equippedTracer`, default kept unlocked on old saves) with unlock/equip + `equippedTracerColor`. Game reads it for local tracers; new Cosmetics grid + tracer swatch CSS.
- ✅ Phase 12E — Announcer specials. DONE. First Blood (match-first kill via a `matchHadKill` flag read-before-set), Revenge (`lastKilledMeBy`), Comeback (`deathsSinceKill >= 3`). Specials headline, multi/streak subline; all reset in `reset()`.
- ✅ Phase 12F — Kill-confirm marker. DONE. Bigger glowing red X on confirmed kill; hit/headshot/kill state classes cleared between flashes.
- ✅ Phase 12 polish — Bumped client+server to v0.12.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer), README Phase 12 section + audio-catalog additions (heartbeat/first_blood/revenge/comeback), deliverables updated. Typecheck (client+server) + client build all green; app chunk ~61 KB gzip.

### Phase 12 COMPLETE — A–F + polish shipped, no protocol change, solo + MP intact.

---

## Phase 13 — Gun Game mode (v0.13.0)

The first NEW GAME MODE — mode variety is the #1 driver of replay value in arena
shooters (Krunker has a dozen). Self-contained, solo-vs-bots for v1, no protocol
or MP changes, fully browser-verified.

- **Weapon ladder** `smg → ar → shotgun → sniper → pistol` (`GUNGAME_LADDER`).
  Each kill advances the killer one rung; the player's gun visibly swaps in hand.
  First to land a kill on the FINAL rung (pistol) wins → post-match overlay.
- **New `modes/GunGame.ts`** — bus-driven, decoupled via a small `GunGameHost`
  interface (isLocalPlayer / setPlayerPrimaryWeapon / playSound). Tracks per-
  participant tiers; bots race too (their tier advances, weapon stays fixed for v1).
- **`GameMode` extended** to `'combat' | 'practice' | 'gungame'` + an `isCombatMode()`
  helper so bots/spawn-protection/map logic treat Gun Game like Combat.
- **New `Game.setPlayerPrimaryWeapon(id)`** — swaps primary + viewmodel. Pistol is
  special-cased (it's the secondary slot; `setPrimary` rejects it) → selects slot 1.
  **Caught + fixed during verification**: without this the final rung silently
  stayed on sniper.
- **HUD**: new top-center Gun Game ticker — "LVL n/5 · WEAPON" + filled pips.
  Shown only in gungame mode; hidden on quit/other modes.
- **Menu**: new "🔫 Gun Game (vs Bots)" button. Play Again restarts the ladder;
  Quit restores the player's chosen loadout weapon.
- Verified in-browser end-to-end: starts on SMG, climbs AR→SHOTGUN→SNIPER→PISTOL
  over 4 kills, 5th kill (on pistol) fires the win + post-match. Typecheck (client)
  + build green; app chunk ~61.6 KB gzip.

### Phase 13 COMPLETE — Gun Game shipped, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 14 — One Shot mode ("One in the Chamber") (v0.14.0)

A SECOND new game mode — mode variety is the strongest replay driver, and a
short, frantic instagib mode is one of the most addictive arena formats (and its
quick 12-kill matches mean frequent post-match ad breakpoints → revenue). Like
Gun Game it's solo-vs-bots for v1, fully client-side, no protocol/MP changes,
and fully verified (typecheck + build + a headless rules test).

- **Instagib (everyone 1-HP).** New `Game.modeMaxHpOverride` flat-overrides the
  player AND every bot's max HP (= 1) so *every* hit is lethal. Read in
  `applyClassPassives` (so class passives / respawns can't override it back) and
  pushed onto bots by `enterOneShot`/`exitOneShot`. null in every other mode.
- **Pistol bullet economy.** The player is locked to the pistol, whose magazine
  IS the ammo bank: start with **3**, **+1 per kill** (cap **6**), and **no
  reloading** — a miss spends a real bullet. New `Weapon.ammoLocked` +
  `setAmmo`/`addAmmo` (guards `startReload` + the empty-fire auto-reload). An
  anti-deadlock **scavenge trickle** refills 1 bullet every 4s while you sit
  empty, and respawns guarantee ≥1 bullet so you're never spawned defenseless.
- **First to 12 kills wins** → the existing post-match overlay (reads
  `matchKills`, so the scoreboard + XP + ad-refresh all "just work"). Play Again
  re-seeds the economy + restarts the race; Quit restores the chosen loadout.
- **Self-contained `modes/OneShot.ts`** mirroring GunGame's bus-driven,
  host-decoupled shape (`OneShotHost`: isLocalPlayer / playSound /
  addLocalBullets / localBulletCount / **isActive**). Per-frame `update()` drives
  the scavenge trickle + HUD sync (fires happen outside the mode, so it polls the
  bullet count and pushes changes).
- **HUD**: new top-center One Shot ticker — "n/12 KILLS · ⦿ bullets" + a magazine
  pip row (filled = banked, dim = spent). Shown only in oneshot; hidden elsewhere.
- **Menu**: new "🎯 One Shot (vs Bots)" button (crimson accent).
- **Weapon-slot lock**: 1/2/Q are consumed-but-ignored in oneshot so the player
  can't bail to their full-ammo primary — the mode is pistol-only by design.
- **Bug fix found along the way (Phase 13 latent leak):** GunGame's permanent
  `kill` subscription had **no mode guard**, so a kill in Combat/MP would advance
  the ladder + swap the player's weapon mid-match. Added `isActive()` to both
  mode hosts (`game.mode === 'gungame'/'oneshot'`) gating their kill handlers.
- Verified: headless rules test (start bullets, kill→bullet refund, cap clamp,
  self-kill ignored, inactive-guard, bot race-to-12 win, post-win lockout) all
  pass; client+server typecheck + client build green; app chunk ~62.5 KB gzip.

### Phase 14 COMPLETE — One Shot shipped, GunGame leak fixed, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

---

## Phase 15 — Crosshair preset packs (v0.15.0)

Krunker-grade crosshair personalization is a signature retention hook — more
"make it yours" = more reason to come back = more sessions = more ad revenue.
The existing customizer already exposed color/size/thickness/gap/outline/dot via
CSS vars; this layers **one-click curated presets** on top. Pure client UI, zero
gameplay/protocol risk.

- **7 presets** (`Default / Dot / Cross / Precision / Bold / Wide / Pro`), each a
  bundle of the existing crosshair vars (incl. a themed color). Clicking one
  writes every control + CSS var + localStorage key, so the sliders/checkboxes
  stay in sync and the choice persists across reloads. A `ui_click` SFX confirms.
- New preset button row at the top of the Crosshair settings pane; wrapping
  pill buttons styled to match the settings panel.
- Verified: client typecheck + build green; 7 preset buttons present in the DOM;
  app chunk ~62.8 KB gzip.

### Phase 15 COMPLETE — Crosshair presets shipped, no gameplay/protocol change.

---

## Phase 16 — Score Attack mode (v0.16.0)

A third game mode + a **persistent personal-best** retention hook. Score Attack
is a 90-second timed frag-rush vs bots: rack up as many kills as you can before
the clock hits zero, then chase your saved best. High-score chasing is one of the
stickiest loops there is, and the fixed 90s length means a **predictable, frequent
post-match ad breakpoint** (revenue). Solo vs bots, client-side, no protocol/MP
changes.

- **New `modes/ScoreAttack.ts`** — *just the clock* (mirrors GunGame/OneShot's
  bus-decoupled `ScoreAttackHost`: playSound / isActive). Per-frame `update()`
  counts down with a tab-stall-clamped dt, fires `onTick(secondsLeft, urgent)`
  on each whole-second change and `onTimeUp()` once at zero. A sub-10s urgency
  cue + pulsing red clock. Score resolution lives in main.ts (it owns the
  post-match scoreboard).
- **Persistent personal best.** `Account` extended migration-safe with
  `scoreAttackBest` + `recordScoreAttack(score)` (returns true on a new record).
  At time-up the post-match overlay shows "★ NEW PERSONAL BEST — N kills in 90s"
  or "N kills · best M".
- **`GameMode` extended** to include `'scoreattack'` (an `isCombatMode`, so bots +
  spawn protection + respawns all behave like Combat). Reuses the existing
  post-match flow (scoreboard + XP + ad refresh).
- **HUD**: top-center M:SS countdown clock (cyan, urgent-red pulse under 10s).
  **Menu**: new "⏱ Score Attack (90s)" button. Play Again restarts the run.
- Verified: headless timer test (start at 90, count-down with clamped dt,
  urgent-flag crossing, single onTimeUp at zero, no double-fire, inactive freeze,
  M:SS formatting) all pass; client+server typecheck + client build green; app
  chunk ~63.3 KB gzip.

### Phase 16 COMPLETE — Score Attack shipped, personal-best persistence, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

- ✅ Phase 16 polish — Surfaced the Score Attack best in the Profile tab stats
  grid, and award a +100 XP bonus for beating your personal best (announced on
  the post-match unlocks line). Typecheck + build green.
