# ILCARTIGO — Phase 11+ Roadmap (autonomous build)

Goal: make the game **fun, catchy, Krunker-feel**, and **revenue-ready (AdSense)**.
Build steadily, one phase at a time, verifying (typecheck + build, headless tests where
possible) after each. Each phase is independently shippable.

Guiding principles:
- **Readable feedback** — every action has instant, juicy feedback (Krunker's core feel).
- **Visible progression** — players see themselves getting better/richer (levels, streaks, stats).
- **Natural ad breakpoints** — ads between matches / on the death+postmatch screen, never mid-combat.
- **Don't regress** — keep solo + MP + the audit fixes working. Typecheck + build green each phase.
- **No new heavy deps.** Stay within the current stack (Vite/TS/Three/Howler/socket.io).

---

## Phase A — Scoreboard (Tab) + live match HUD polish  ✅ shippable
The single most "Krunker" missing piece: hold **Tab** to see a full scoreboard.
- Tab-held overlay: rank, player name, kills, deaths, K/D, ping (MP). Works solo (you+bots) and MP.
- Sort by kills desc, highlight local player.
- Reuse `Game.matchKills/matchDeaths`; in MP pull from snapshot `kills` so it's authoritative.
- Polish the existing top-center match ticker.
Files: `index.html` (overlay DOM), `main.ts` (Tab key + render), `HUD.ts` (maybe), `site.css`/game css.

## Phase B — Killstreaks + "juice"  ✅ shippable
Krunker-style momentum feedback.
- Track consecutive kills without dying (local player). Announce streaks: Double Kill, Triple,
  Rampage, Unstoppable, Godlike — center-screen banner + escalating sound.
- Multi-kill timing window (kills within ~4s chain into Double/Triple/Multi).
- Hitmarker scale-up + sharper kill confirmation. Headshot = special marker + ding (already partly there).
- Low-HP vignette pulse.
Files: new `client/src/ui/Announcer.ts`, wire into `Game` kill bus, css, sounds catalog (already has hooks).

## Phase C — Footsteps + audio depth  ✅ shippable (finishes audit #footstep)
- Distance-throttled footstep emit in PlayerController (the audit's last unwired sound).
- Per-class footstep volume (Phantom silent, Ghost half) using existing passive fields.
- Remote-player footsteps (spatial) from snapshot movement.
Files: `PlayerController.ts`, `Game.ts`, `MultiplayerSession.ts`, `AudioManager.ts`.

## Phase D — Class selection in MP  ✅ shippable (closes a README limitation)
- Players already pick class in the menu (localStorage `ilc.class`); sync it over the wire.
- `ClientHello` already carries `classId` — make the menu selection actually flow to MP + verify
  abilities/passives work online for all 6 classes (server already validates classId).
- Show other players' class color/identity.
Files: `main.ts` (send hello on class change — already partly wired), verify server `onHello`.

## Phase E — Progression depth + stat tracking  ✅ shippable
Catchy long-term hooks + more reasons to come back.
- Persistent lifetime stats: total kills, deaths, K/D, matches, wins, best streak, headshots, playtime.
- Stats tab in settings (or new "Profile" panel). XP/level already exist — surface lifetime stats too.
- Daily challenge-lite (local): "get 20 kills", "win a match", "5 headshots" → bonus XP. No backend.
Files: `Account.ts` (extend persisted state, migration-safe), new `ProfileUI` / extend CosmeticsUI, css.

## Phase F — AdSense revenue integration  ✅ shippable (the money)
- Interstitial-style ad slot on the **post-match overlay** + **main menu** (natural breakpoints).
- Reserved, responsive ad containers that show a tasteful placeholder until a real `ca-pub` is set.
- Single config point for the publisher id; AdSense script loads only when id is real (not XXXX).
- Respect the existing cookie-consent banner on the website; add a minimal consent gate in-game.
Files: `index.html` (ad containers), new `client/src/ads/Ads.ts`, `main.ts` wiring, css.

## Phase G — UX / first-session catch (retention)  ✅ shippable
- Name entry (persisted) so the scoreboard shows a chosen handle, not a socket id.
- Quick "how to play" first-run card; settings to replay it.
- Crosshair/loadout quick-access; remember last loadout.
Files: `main.ts`, `index.html`, `Account.ts` (name), css.

## Phase H — README + version bump + polish sweep
- Update README with all new phases, bump to the appropriate version.
- Re-run the audit's remaining minor items (respawn-countdown race, iPad gate) if not already done.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase A — Tab scoreboard. DONE + browser-verified (sorted rows, K/D, bot names, "You" highlight, keyup hides). Dev-only `window.game` added for testing (stripped from prod).
- ✅ Phase B — Killstreak/multi-kill announcer. DONE + browser-verified (Double→Mega chain, streak milestones, headline/subline priority, death resets). 11 new sound ids (silent until .wav added). New `ui/Announcer.ts`.
- ✅ Phase C — Footsteps. DONE (typecheck + build clean, wiring verified). Local footsteps (distance-throttled stride, per-class volume via passive, crouch lengthens stride) + remote spatial footsteps in MP (RemotePlayer accumulator, cloak-silent, ignores teleports). Couldn't watch real footfalls in the throttled/lock-gated headless tab — accumulator is deterministic, will fire in a real session.
- ✅ Phase D — MP class selection. DONE + headless-verified. Found the client class flow was ALREADY wired (README's "locked to Vanguard" was stale). Real bugs fixed: two class PASSIVES were silently MP-broken because the server is authoritative but never applied them — Vanguard's +15 HP (server killed them at 100) and Engineer's -15% cooldown. Added CLASS_MAX_HP + CLASS_COOLDOWN_MULT server tables; smoke test confirms Vanguard=115 HP server-side + clean class-switch clamp.
- ✅ Phase E — Lifetime stats + daily challenges. DONE + browser-verified end-to-end. Account extended (migration-safe) with LifetimeStats (kills/deaths/hs/matches/wins/bestStreak/playtime) + daily challenges (seeded-per-day, 3 picked, baseline-captured-at-issue, claim grants bonus XP) + display name. New Profile settings tab (ProfileUI). Wired stat recording into Game kill/death/match-end + playtime tick. Caught+fixed a baseline off-by-one during verification. Claim flow confirmed (+300 XP). New `ui/ProfileUI.ts`.
- ✅ Phase F — AdSense. DONE + browser-verified. New `ads/Ads.ts` — single-config-point publisher id, slots at natural breakpoints (menu top/side + post-match), tasteful in-house placeholders until a real id is set (NO empty real units = policy-safe), no AdSense script loads in placeholder mode (verified), consent-aware npa fallback, refreshSlot on each post-match. Gate logic verified (placeholder→off, real id→on).
- ✅ Phase G — First-session UX. DONE + browser-verified. Name entry shipped in Phase E. Loadout persistence (class/primary/map) already existed. New: first-run "How to Play" card — auto-shows once for new players (gated by ilc.seenHowto), dismiss sets flag, replayable from a new "How to Play" main-menu button. Verified: auto-show, 8 control items, dismiss+flag, menu replay.
- ✅ Phase H — Polish + docs. DONE. Fixed respawn-countdown race (audit #10 — 0.25s grace before auto-clear) + iPad-landscape mobile gate (audit #11 — `(any-pointer: fine)` so touch-only tablets gated even when wide). Bumped client+server to v0.11.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer). README updated with the full Phase 11 section. Hit a UTF-8 BOM gotcha from PowerShell `Set-Content -Encoding utf8` corrupting package.json → rewrote both via Write (BOM-free); both validate + build clean.

### Phase 11 COMPLETE — all 8 sub-phases (A–H) + audit-fix round shipped, typecheck + build green, app chunk ~59 KB gzip.

## Phase 12 — Combat Feel & Feedback Juice (autonomous build, v0.12.0)

The single biggest gap between ILCARTIGO and Krunker right now is *moment-to-moment
combat feedback* — you can't tell where you're being shot from, low-HP has no
tension, death is abrupt, and there's only one cosmetic axis to chase. Phase 12
closes that, all client-side and low-risk (no protocol changes, solo + MP both
keep working), plus one new cosmetic track to deepen the unlock loop (retention →
ad revenue).

Guiding constraint: **no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green each step.**

- **12A — Directional damage indicators.** Red curved arcs around the crosshair
  pointing at whoever's shooting you (CoD/Krunker staple). Computed from the
  attacker's world position vs camera yaw. Works solo (bots) + MP (remotes).
  New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`, `Game.actorWorldPos()` resolver,
  `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition()`.
- **12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat.** Persistent pulsing red vignette + a
  throttled heartbeat SFX cue when HP drops under a threshold. Pure HUD + CSS.
- **12C — Death recap card.** "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}" on the death
  screen, folded into the respawn countdown. Captured from the lethal kill event.
- **12D — Tracer-colour cosmetics.** A new unlockable cosmetic axis (your bullet
  tracer colour). Extends the registry + Account + Cosmetics settings tab; the
  local player's tracers read the equipped colour. More to chase = more reasons
  to return.
- **12E — Announcer specials.** First Blood (first kill of a match), Revenge
  (kill whoever last killed you), Comeback (kill after a long death drought).
  Pure `Announcer.ts` extension on top of the existing streak/multi-kill system.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 12A — Directional damage indicators. DONE (typecheck + build green). New `ui/DamageDirection.ts`; pooled red arcs rotate about screen centre to the attacker's bearing (camera-yaw projection). Attacker position via new `Game.actorWorldPos` (local/bot/MP-remote) + `MultiplayerSession.getRemotePosition`. Merges continuous fire, separate arcs for multiple attackers, skips attacker-less hits.
- ✅ Phase 12B — Low-HP vignette + heartbeat. DONE. Pulsing red `#lowhp-vignette` + throttled `heartbeat` SFX at ≤30% HP (cadence 500–950ms, tighter near death). HUD-driven, edge-toggled.
- ✅ Phase 12C — Death recap card. DONE. "ELIMINATED BY {name} · {WEAPON}(·HS)" inside the respawn countdown; resolves bot labels / short MP ids; hidden for falls.
- ✅ Phase 12D — Bullet-tracer cosmetics. DONE. `TRACERS` registry (6, 0–2000 XP) + `findTracer`/`DEFAULT_TRACER`. Account extended migration-safe (`unlockedTracers`/`equippedTracer`, default kept unlocked on old saves) with unlock/equip + `equippedTracerColor`. Game reads it for local tracers; new Cosmetics grid + tracer swatch CSS.
- ✅ Phase 12E — Announcer specials. DONE. First Blood (match-first kill via a `matchHadKill` flag read-before-set), Revenge (`lastKilledMeBy`), Comeback (`deathsSinceKill >= 3`). Specials headline, multi/streak subline; all reset in `reset()`.
- ✅ Phase 12F — Kill-confirm marker. DONE. Bigger glowing red X on confirmed kill; hit/headshot/kill state classes cleared between flashes.
- ✅ Phase 12 polish — Bumped client+server to v0.12.0 (+ menu subtitle/footer), README Phase 12 section + audio-catalog additions (heartbeat/first_blood/revenge/comeback), deliverables updated. Typecheck (client+server) + client build all green; app chunk ~61 KB gzip.

### Phase 12 COMPLETE — A–F + polish shipped, no protocol change, solo + MP intact.

## Phase 13 — Gun Game mode (v0.13.0)

The first NEW GAME MODE — mode variety is the #1 driver of replay value in arena
shooters (Krunker has a dozen). Self-contained, solo-vs-bots for v1, no protocol
or MP changes, fully browser-verified.

- **Weapon ladder** `smg → ar → shotgun → sniper → pistol` (`GUNGAME_LADDER`).
  Each kill advances the killer one rung; the player's gun visibly swaps in hand.
  First to land a kill on the FINAL rung (pistol) wins → post-match overlay.
- **New `modes/GunGame.ts`** — bus-driven, decoupled via a small `GunGameHost`
  interface (isLocalPlayer / setPlayerPrimaryWeapon / playSound). Tracks per-
  participant tiers; bots race too (their tier advances, weapon stays fixed for v1).
- **`GameMode` extended** to `'combat' | 'practice' | 'gungame'` + an `isCombatMode()`
  helper so bots/spawn-protection/map logic treat Gun Game like Combat.
- **New `Game.setPlayerPrimaryWeapon(id)`** — swaps primary + viewmodel. Pistol is
  special-cased (it's the secondary slot; `setPrimary` rejects it) → selects slot 1.
  **Caught + fixed during verification**: without this the final rung silently
  stayed on sniper.
- **HUD**: new top-center Gun Game ticker — "LVL n/5 · WEAPON" + filled pips.
  Shown only in gungame mode; hidden on quit/other modes.
- **Menu**: new "🔫 Gun Game (vs Bots)" button. Play Again restarts the ladder;
  Quit restores the player's chosen loadout weapon.
- Verified in-browser end-to-end: starts on SMG, climbs AR→SHOTGUN→SNIPER→PISTOL
  over 4 kills, 5th kill (on pistol) fires the win + post-match. Typecheck (client)
  + build green; app chunk ~61.6 KB gzip.

### Phase 13 COMPLETE — Gun Game shipped, solo + MP intact, no protocol change.

## Phase 14 — Survival (Horde) mode (v0.14.0)

The second NEW GAME MODE — a score-chasing, wave-based **Survival** mode. This
is the ideal next mode because the existing bot AI *only ever targets the
player*, which is exactly the "you vs an endless horde" fantasy. It's catchy
(personal high-score chase = retention), gives **natural ad breakpoints**
(game-over screen, between waves), and needs **no protocol or MP changes** —
fully client-side, solo, self-contained like Gun Game.

Design:
- **Waves.** Each wave spawns a batch of bots (count grows, difficulty
  escalates: wanderer → engager → predictor mix shifts upward). Clear every bot
  in a wave → short breather + "WAVE n" banner → next wave, harder.
- **No respawn.** In Survival the player has ONE life. Death = game over (the
  combat-mode auto-respawn is gated off for `survival`). A dedicated game-over
  card shows wave reached, kills, score, and your best — with an ad slot.
- **Score.** `kills*100 + wavesCleared*500`. Persisted bests
  (`survivalBestWave`, `survivalBestKills`, `survivalBestScore`) in `Account`
  (migration-safe), surfaced on the game-over card + Profile tab.
- **Dynamic bots.** `Bot` gains `autoRespawn` (off for survival → no self-respawn)
  + `dispose()`. `Game` gains `spawnBot()` / `removeBot()` so the mode controller
  owns wave bot lifecycle. Base 3 combat bots stay deactivated during survival.
  Same `game.bots` array instance is mutated in place so `Pulse`/ability refs
  stay valid.
- **HUD.** New top-center survival ticker (WAVE · ENEMIES · SCORE) + a center
  wave banner. New `modes/Survival.ts` (bus-driven, decoupled via `SurvivalHost`,
  mirroring `GunGame`). Menu button "💀 Survival (vs Bots)".

Guiding constraint: **no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green,
never break solo/MP/Gun Game.**

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 14 — Survival (Horde) mode. DONE (typecheck + build green; wave logic
  headless-verified end-to-end). New `modes/Survival.ts` (bus-driven, decoupled
  via `SurvivalHost`). `Bot` gained `autoRespawn` (off for horde bots → no
  self-respawn) + `dispose()`. `Game` gained `spawnBot()` / `removeBot()` /
  `ffaSpawns()`, `'survival'` GameMode (in `isCombatMode`), base-bot activation
  narrowed to combat/gungame, and one-life death gating (no auto-respawn in
  survival). Account extended migration-safe with `SurvivalBest`
  (bestWave/bestKills/bestScore) + `recordSurvival()`, surfaced on the Profile
  tab. New HUD survival ticker + center wave banner + game-over card (with an ad
  slot at the game-over breakpoint → `Ads` `survival` slot). Menu button
  "💀 Survival (vs Bots)". Headless smoke test confirmed: wave 1 (3 bots) →
  clear (+500) → breather → wave 2 (4 bots) → player death → game over with
  arena cleanup; post-death kills are inert.
- ✅ Audit fix (found building Phase 14): `GunGame` subscribed to the kill bus
  in its constructor but was never mode-gated — so kills in Combat (and now
  Survival) would advance the weapon ladder and fire a false post-match
  "VICTORY" after 5 kills. Added an `enabled` guard (set in `start()`, cleared
  in new `stop()`); `main.ts` stops both mode controllers on every transition.

### Phase 14 COMPLETE — Survival mode shipped, solo + MP + Gun Game intact, no protocol change. App chunk ~63 KB gzip.

---

## Phase 15 — Health pickups (v0.15.0)

Arena sustain — floating med-kits the player walks over to heal. Deepens every
combat mode and has strong synergy with the new Survival mode (sustain to push
deeper into the horde). Reserve ammo is infinite in this game, so ammo pickups
would be no-ops — **health is the meaningful pickup**.

- **Solo + combat-mode only.** MP healing would need server authority (protocol
  change) → out of scope; pickups are gated to `!mp` + `isCombatMode`. Built/torn
  down on every map/mode/MP transition via `Game.refreshPickups()`.
- **`entities/HealthPickup.ts`** — a glowing green med-kit (white cross + ground
  glow ring) that bobs + spins. Collected on proximity ONLY when the player is
  below full HP (no waste), heals +40, then goes on a 14s cooldown and respawns.
- **Placement.** Optional `MapMeta.healthSpawns`; if a map omits it, the engine
  derives anchors by pulling each FFA spawn ~55% toward centre (open lanes).
- **Feedback.** Green edge flash + floating "+40 HP" popup + `pickup_health` SFX
  (silent until the `.wav` lands). New `Game.onHealthPickup` hook.

Guiding constraint: no protocol changes, no new deps, typecheck + build green,
solo/MP/Gun Game/Survival all intact.

### Status log
- ✅ Phase 15 — Health pickups. DONE (typecheck + build green; collect/cooldown
  logic headless-verified). New `entities/HealthPickup.ts`; `Game` owns the set
  (`refreshPickups()` on map/mode/MP change), heals on collect, fires
  `onHealthPickup`. `MapMeta.healthSpawns` optional + FFA-derived fallback. New
  `pickup_health` SoundId. HUD green flash + "+HP" popup. Smoke test confirmed:
  no collect when far / at full HP, collect when hurt+near, cooldown blocks
  re-collect, respawns after 14s.

### Phase 15 COMPLETE — Health pickups shipped (solo combat), no protocol change.
